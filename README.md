# New World Travel

The New World Travel site is designed to be a type of blog for holiday and lovers. It is designed to allow people to read valuable information on specific holiday and travel locations to help users decide on destinations or even create a travel bucket list.

They will be able to find lots of information as well as subscribing to a newsletter that will inform users on new destinations being added by filling out a very short form.

## Subscription Form
At the bottom of every page there is a subscription form. This form allows users to input a few basic details including email address that would add them onto a mailing list to be notified of new destinations being added to the destinations page. The form has been styled and created with validation meaning you cannot press submit without at least entering a valid email address

## Footer
The footer is the same on every page. It provides 3 links to social media platforms. The links open in new tabs so that they do not have to leave the site but encourages users to subscribe to multiple platforms
