# New World Travel

The New World Travel site is designed to be a type of blog for holiday and lovers. It is designed to allow people to read valuable information on specific holiday and travel locations to help users decide on destinations or even create a travel bucket list.

They will be able to find lots of information as well as receiving a personalised destination recommendation by filling out a very short form.

# Planning
## My aim
My overall aim was to create a website that passionate travellers could visit to read about all different destinations or for us to help.

## User experience
I wanted my users to have a seemless experience and to find it easy to navigate the different pages and features

## Intended Users
The intended users for this project was for anybody who had an interest or passion for travelling

## Site Features
I wanted the site to have lots of images of potential destinations that fit in with the theme with a good encylopedia of information. However I also wanted the user to have the ability to contact us directly for a more personalised experience.

# Features

## Nav Menu
Every single page has the same navigation menu. The menu has a link to all 3 pages. The navigation menu is responsive on mobile. The links condense into 3 lines on mobile and when clicked the links will appear. It will allow users to navigate the website with ease without having to click the back button

## Main Page
The main page has an image of a sunset to match the theme of the site with a brief overview introducing what the site is about. It also comes with an about us section again just explaining what we were trying to achieve.

## Contact Form and page
The third page of the site is a contact us page that comes with a contactfform.. This form allows users to input a few basic details and once submitted, we would be able to send them a personalised holiday recommendation based on the information provided. The form has been styled and created with validation meaning you cannot press submit without at least entering a valid email address, name and details of a dream holiday.

## Footer
The footer is the same on every page. It provides 3 links to social media platforms. The links open in new tabs so that they do not have to leave the site but encourages users to subscribe to multiple platforms

## Destinations Page
The destinations page features the small list of visited destinations and a paragraph explaining the attraction to each location and so must do activities. Each destination is accompaniesd by a picture of each location. This page is responsive so that the image and text move alongside each other and flow more freely on larger screens.

# Testing and Bugs/issues
I have tested all links on all pages and found no broken links and all of them are linked to the correct pages. The navigation bar was tested on multiple devices and works really well on mobile devices meaning it is hidden until asked for making the page much more pleasant and responsive for the user. 
 
I have tested the subscription form to ensure that when the submit button is pressed it goes to the correct link. I have tested this on all pages. 

I have ensured that all pages are responsive to different mobile devices and desktops to ensure the experience is pleasant for the users. 

## Bugs/ Issues
I found there was a big issue during my project that I had to seek tutor support for. I noticed that I was saving my work and refreshing my browser and no changes were actually occuring. This is in relation to my CSS. This became increasingly frustrating as I felt like I was actually completing the CSS wrong even with all the guidance. I also noticed that I could save the work and load the project a few days later and all of a sudden the CSS changes were made. But then it was a vicious cycle. I was told by a tutor that CodeAnywhere does have issues with saving and taught me a workaround to hard save and hard refresh the browser. Since this I have not had issues when trying to view my work once the code was written. In terms of other issues I actually did not find any, this was the big one that I had to seek assistance for as it dramatically slowed down my project.

With relation to this they also found an issue meaning every time I wanted my Git Commits to actually show in my repository I also had to do an additional Git Push action.

## Validator Testing
HTML - I found no errors when running this through the W3C Validator. There was some guidance with regards to some slashes. I attempted to correct this, however when I saved the document, CodeAnywhere took it back to the original state meaning I could not fix further.

CSS - I found no errors when running this through the Jigsaw Validator

## Lighthouse Validation
I completed a lighthouse check on all of my pages for mobile and desktop. I have provided images of these below

These are the main page lighthouse validator results.

# Deployment
To deploy my site on Git Hub I made the following steps. These instructions were taken from the love running project.
1. Go to the Settings tab of your GitHub repo.
2. On the left-hand sidebar, in the Code and automation section, select Pages.
3. Make sure: Source is set to 'Deploy from Branch'.
4. Main branch is selected.
5. Folder is set to / (root).
6. Under Branch, click Save.
7. Go back to the Code tab. Wait a few minutes for the build to finish and refresh your repo.
8. On the right-hand side, in the Environments section, click on 'github-pages'.
9. Click View deployment to see the live site

The logo images issued in the footer were from https://fontawesome.com/

The Nav Menu toggle button for mobile devices was also taken from https://fontawesome.com/

My mobile navigation menu had some code from the love running project. I really liked their way of condensing down the nav menu for mobile devices and so I made extensive notes so that I could impliment my own version of this.

# Other General Project Advice/ Lessons
The biggest lesson I learnt from this project is to ensure that you commit to Git Hub often and regularly. Initially at the start of the project this was not my strongest area. However further down the line I could see how regular commits would benefit an entire team who were working on a project together as they could see the progress made and the different developmental stages. I did notice towards the end that as I got further into the project I found more ways to improve so did find myself revisting certain sections to either rectify issues or to make them better.

One lesson I learnt is also to take a step back before developing and map out on paper which areas I want to develop first to make it properly structured and to make my processes more efficient. With this I have learnt why developing sites for mobile devices first and adding media queries for larger screens is more efficient and better for users.
